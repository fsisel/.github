## Repos Development Guide
There is a **main** branch by default. This branch should be stable, this means ready for production.
When a new version is completed, the developer should create a *tag* and if needed (recomended) also a *release*.
When in development stage, the developer should commit to a separate branch. This can be in one of two way:
- In a branch called **dev** or **development**.
- Or by creating a new branch called **feat/name_of_the_feature** or **fix/name_of_the_bug**.
